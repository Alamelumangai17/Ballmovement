## Ball Movement

The provided HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple webpage with an animated green ball that moves back and forth within specified boundaries. Below is a "Code Readme" explaining the purpose and functioning of the code:

# steps to run the project

 step 1
 
   - The  element with the ID "ball" represents the green ball.
   - It's styled with CSS attributes for its appearance, including its color, size, and position.

step 2:

   - The moveball function is called repeatedly by setInterval to create the animation effect.
     
Future improvements

In summary, this code creates a simple, interactive animation where a green ball moves horizontally and vertically within defined boundaries, changing direction when it reaches those boundaries. The animation speed can be adjusted by changing the velocity variable. This code could serve as a basic example for understanding how to animate elements using JavaScript in a webpage.
